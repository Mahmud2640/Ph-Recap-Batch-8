# Batch 8 Learning Recap

Welcome to my Batch 8 learning recap repository! In this repository, I'll be documenting all the code and concepts I learn from the Batch 8 videos and lectures.

## About Batch 8

Batch 8 is the latest release from Programming Hero, an online platform dedicated to teaching programming and software development skills. This batch covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Advanced algorithms and data structures
- Web development frameworks such as React and Next js
- Mobile app development with React Native
- Deployment strategies and DevOps practices

## Learning Objectives

My primary goal with this repository is to consolidate my learning from Batch 8 and reinforce the concepts by implementing them in code. Some specific objectives include:

- Understanding the core concepts discussed in each video lecture
- Implementing code examples provided in the lectures
- Building additional projects to practice and solidify my understanding
- Collaborating with peers to discuss and solve coding challenges

## Repository Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or project covered in Batch 8.
- Inside each folder, you'll find detailed documentation, code examples, and any additional resources relevant to that topic.
- Feel free to explore the folders and dive into the code!
